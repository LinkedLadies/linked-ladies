      "description": "'Haven' was inspired by the local wildfires in Napa Valley for TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon in SF. We wanted to create a cross-device platform where a victim in an emergency disaster can bring awareness to their community to ultimately receive help. Once an incident is reported, the community is notified of a direct method to offer aid. First responders can locate those who need medical attention; a local neighbor can offer up their spare room for shelter."
